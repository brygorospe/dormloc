			<p> Residence Finder was once a study devised by four FEU - Institute of Technology students that seeks to lessen the hassle caused by hunting student's abode in the old-fashioned way </p>
			<p> wherein parents or students themselves need to expose theirselves, walk through the heat and several blocks, just to find an adequate place for them to stay. </p>
			<p> Furthermore, as a response to the fast changing phase of the technology, these students developed a system parallel to the study. </p>
			<p> This web application includes features wherein user(s) can set the filters based on their own preference in considering an abode. </p>
			<p> Moreover, this web application is only limited to locate different residences within the university belt in Manila area. </p>
